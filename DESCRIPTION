Description: We propose a consistent monitoring procedure to detect a
    structural change from a cointegrating relationship to a spurious
    relationship. The procedure is based on residuals from modified least
    squares estimation, using either Fully Modified, Dynamic or Integrated
    Modified OLS. It is inspired by Chu et al. (1996) <DOI:10.2307/2171955> in
    that it is based on
    parameter estimation on a pre-break "calibration" period only, rather than
    being based on sequential estimation over the full sample.
    See the discussion paper <DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2624657> for further information.
    This package provides the monitoring procedures for both the cointegration
    and the stationarity case (while the latter is just a special case of the
    former one) as well as printing and plotting methods for a clear
    presentation of the results.
